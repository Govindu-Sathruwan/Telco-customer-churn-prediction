## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn in the telecommunications industry, identifying key factors contributing to churn and proposing solutions to reduce customer loss. We used R for data preprocessing, modelling, and visualization.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major issue in the telecom industry, where acquiring a new customer is significantly more expensive than retaining an existing one. Our goal is to:  
•	Identify key factors influencing churn.  
•	Develop a regression model to predict churn likelihood.  
•	Provide insights and recommendations to reduce churn.  

## 📂 Repository Structure


## 🔧 Technologies Used  
•	R and R studio  
•	ggplot2   

## 📈 Methodology
1.	Data Preprocessing  
o	Cleaned and transformed raw data.  
o	Converted categorical variables into factors.  
o	Split data into training (65%) and testing (35%) sets.  

2.	Modeling & Evaluation  
o	Built multiple linear regression models.  
o	Applied forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise regression to optimize the model.  
o	Evaluated model performance using Adjusted R², Residual Standard Error (RSE), and significance tests.  

3.	Results & Insights  
o	Identified key predictors of churn, including contract type, monthly charges, and support services.  
o	Provided recommendations for reducing churn, such as improving customer service and offering better retention deals.  

## 🎯 Key Findings  
•	Customers with month-to-month contracts were more likely to churn.  
•	Higher monthly charges correlated with increased churn risk.  
•	Lack of tech support and online backup contributed to higher churn rates.  
•	Retention strategies like loyalty discounts and proactive customer service can help reduce churn.  

## 📢 Recommendations  
•	Improve customer service training and response times.  
•	Introduce tailored retention offers for at-risk customers.  
•	Offer discounted long-term contracts to reduce churn.  
•	Enhance service bundles with tech support and cloud storage.
